# ELEC576project
Semi-supervised Segmentation of  High-resolution Neuronal Cells
- #### Traditional method segmenation is in ELEC576project/dataloaders/segmentation.py 
- #### Data augmentation method is implemented in ELEC576project/dataloaders/PairedNeurons.py
- #### You can train the pix2pixHD model by running ELEC576project/train_pix2pixHD.py 
- #### You can test our model by running ELEC576project/test_pix2pixHD.py
